## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Examination Timetabling Problem

The examination timetabling problem (ETP) has been extensively studied in operations research and computer science literature. Carter and Laporte (1996) provide a comprehensive survey of early approaches, while Qu et al. (2009) present more recent developments.

**Problem Classification:**
- **Type:** Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
- **Complexity:** NP-Hard
- **Domain:** Educational Scheduling
- **Constraints:** Hard (must satisfy) and Soft (preferred)

### 2.2 Optimization Algorithms in Timetabling

#### 2.2.1 Genetic Algorithms
Genetic Algorithms have been successfully applied to timetabling problems since the 1990s. Burke et al. (2004) demonstrate their effectiveness in educational scheduling contexts.

**Advantages:**
- Global search capability
- Population-based approach
- Natural constraint handling
- Scalability to large problems

**Disadvantages:**
- Premature convergence
- Parameter sensitivity
- Local optima trapping

#### 2.2.2 Simulated Annealing
Simulated Annealing, introduced by Kirkpatrick et al. (1983), has shown excellent performance in escaping local optima.

**Advantages:**
- Local search capability
- Probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions
- Parameter robustness
- Convergence guarantees

**Disadvantages:**
- Sequential nature

#### 2.2.3 Hybrid Approaches
Recent research has shown that combining multiple algorithms can yield superior results. Al-Betar et al. (2012) demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in educational timetabling.

### 2.3 Existing Solutions

Several commercial and academic timetabling systems exist:

1. **Scientia Syllabus Plus:** Commercial solution with limited algorithm transparency
2. **OpenSIS:** Open-source but basic optimization capabilities
3. **Academic Timetabling Systems:** Research-focused with limited deployment

**Gap Analysis:** Existing solutions lack the combination of advanced algorithms, modern web interfaces, and educational institution-specific features.

        if time_key not in time_groups:
            time_groups[time_key] = []
        time_groups[time_key].append(assignment)
    
    # Check for conflicts
    for time_key, assignments in time_groups.items():
